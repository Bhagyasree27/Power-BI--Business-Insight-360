## Business Insights 360 Dashboard for Finance, Sales, Marketing and Supply Chain

AtliQ Hardwares is a consumer electronics company expanding rapidly but is not able to compete with other companies using data as most of their report still exists in Excel. This was especially holding them back in the Latin American market. Our goal was to free them from Excel's limitations and give them advanced tools for smarter decision-making. My goal is to implement an advanced analytics solution using Power BI that will enable the company to get insights and make informed decisions.

## Project Description:
In this project, the goal is to be one report which could be used by stakeholders from sales, marketing, finance and executive team. The focus is made on the following:
1. Robust Data Modeling
2. User-empathetic Report design
3. Drillable Insights

### Aim:
We aimed to create a powerful dashboard for AtliQ, not just to see how the business is doing but to use data for making better decisions. Think of it as upgrading from a basic tool to a supercharged data-driven decision-making machine!

### Tools used:
Excel - Data validation.
SQL - Data Analysis and validation.
Power BI - For creating reports.
DAX Studio- For Data Optimization.
Power BI Service - For Publishing reports and providing RLS(Row level security).

### Data Cleaning/Preperation:
In the initial data preperation phase, we performed the following tasks:
 Data loading and Inspection.
 Handling missing/null values.
 Data cleaning and formatting.

 ### I've enhanced my skills on the following things in this project:

1. Power Query (Basic and Advanced Operations) 
2. Basic and complex DAX formulas
3. Data modelling involving 10+ tables
4. Choosing the right visuals and formatting
5. Dashboard designing principles
6. Using bookmarks
7. Deploying in Power BI service
8. Stakeholder Feedback Implementation
9. Sales, Marketing, Finance & Supply Chain metrics
